# Agentic RAG

This agent enhances the Agent Starter Pack with a production-ready data ingestion pipeline, enriching your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. You will be able to ingest, process, and embed custom data, improving the relevance and context of your generated responses. You can choose between different datastore options including Vertex AI Search and Vertex AI Vector Search depending on your specific needs.

The agent provides the infrastructure to create a Vertex AI Pipeline with your custom code. Because it's built on Vertex AI Pipelines, you benefit from features like scheduled runs, recurring executions, and on-demand triggers. For processing terabyte-scale data, we recommend combining Vertex AI Pipelines with data analytics tools like BigQuery or Dataflow.
