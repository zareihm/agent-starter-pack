# Multimodal Live Agent

This pattern showcases a real-time conversational RAG agent powered by Google Gemini. The agent handles audio, video, and text interactions while leveraging tool calling with a vector DB for grounded responses.

**Key components:**

- **Python Backend** (in `app/` folder): A production-ready server built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [google-genai](https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/) that features:

  - **Real-time bidirectional communication** via WebSockets between the frontend and Gemini model
  - **Integrated tool calling** with vector database support for contextual document retrieval
  - **Production-grade reliability** with retry logic and automatic reconnection capabilities
  - **Deployment flexibility** supporting both AI Studio and Vertex AI endpoints
  - **Feedback logging endpoint** for collecting user interactions

- **React Frontend** (in `frontend/` folder): Extends the [Multimodal live API Web Console](https://github.com/google-gemini/multimodal-live-api-web-console), with added features like **custom URLs** and **feedback collection**.

Once both the backend and frontend are running, click the play button in the frontend UI to establish a connection with the backend. You can now interact with the Multimodal Live Agent! You can try asking questions such as "Using the tool you have, define Governance in the context MLOPs" to allow the agent to use the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/deploy-operate-generative-ai-applications) it was provided to.
